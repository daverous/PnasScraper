# PnasScraper
Simple scraper thats written in nodejs to scrape sites - can be heavily improved on


## Running the scraper

Currently, the scraper is set up to track publications from 2010 - this can easily be altered in the future - but i'm tired. 

You will need node to run this -

(can download here)

Then - run:

`npm install`

`npm start`

and voila, your data will be in `data.csv`. 


Much Love,
